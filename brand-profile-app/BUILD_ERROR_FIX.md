# Build Error Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Module '@radix-ui/react-label' Not Found

### **Problem**
- Build error: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-label'`
- The dependency was listed in `package.json` but not properly installed in `node_modules`

### **Root Cause**
The dependencies were added to `package.json` manually but `npm install` was not executed from the correct directory, causing the packages to not be physically installed in the `node_modules` folder.

### **Solution Applied**

1. **Corrected Working Directory**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Onboarding\brand-profile-app"
   ```

2. **Reinstalled Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   - Successfully installed 8 new packages
   - All shadcn/ui dependencies now properly resolved

3. **Fixed Next.js Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // next.config.ts
   import type { NextConfig } from "next";
   import path from "path";

   const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
     turbopack: {
       root: path.resolve(__dirname), // Fixed absolute path warning
     },
   };
   ```

### **Verified Dependencies Installed**
All required shadcn/ui packages are now properly installed:
- `@radix-ui/react-label` ✅
- `@radix-ui/react-slot` ✅
- `class-variance-authority` ✅
- `clsx` ✅
- `lucide-react` ✅

### **Application Status**

### **Files Verified**
